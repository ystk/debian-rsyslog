This module was created for a custom project with a very specific use
case. It was included into the source tree as a sample if someone
would like to create similar work. I strongly doubt it has any
value to the community other than serving as an example. Thus,
I do not intend to maintain this module, except if a sponsor
comes up that actually wants this to be done. I prefer to
leave it in the source tree even if it is broken starting with v8.
If that creates a problem, I would simply delete it.
